# Groth Software Solutions Homepage

The source code for my company's website -  [grothsoftwaresolutions.no](https://grothsoftwaresolutions.no/). It is built without
any frameworks.

### Overview
* Uses Vite for the build process which bundles and minifies artifacts
* TypeScript for scripting
* Partials used for common elements like header and footer
* Markdown to HTML blog post conversion tool
* Custom analytics library (that is actually privacy respecting!)
